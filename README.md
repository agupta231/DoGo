# DoGo

## Context
A **Do**cker + **Go** playground. Really just a repository to learn the new Google language and the
"deployment technology of the future."

## Disclaimer
This is a goofing around / learning a new languge type of project, and most of the code doesn't
conform to "good programming practices". This project also has no plans to be maintained. I urge
you to use your common sense if you decide to reference parts of this project.
